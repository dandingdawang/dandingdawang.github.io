	History of Guobaorou
</h1>
<p>
â€‹	This Chinese dish(guobaorou) was invented in the late Qing Dynasty and often translated as "double cooked pork slices" or "fried pork in scoop", of which neither succeeded in fully delivering this canonical represensative of Northeast Chinese Cuisine. In 1907, Zheng Xingwen, who then worked as a government chef, under the instruction of the official Du Xueying  refined the  salty version of guobaorou to a sour sweet one for his guests, mostly Russians, seemed to prefer the latter way of cooking. At the very begining the dish was considered a private property and appeared only on the tables of governers, but since the intrusion of Japanese it began to spread to places outside Harbin. The dish continued to evolve and vary, and presently it is of the most favored dishes by the Chinese people.
